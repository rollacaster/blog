I have just finished my fist elisp package [[https://github.com/rollacaster/elcontext][elcontext]]. It introduces context
based actions for Emacs.
** Context based actions
A context-based action is an Emacs command called under certain conditions.
These conditions can include the current time (similar to a [[https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cron][cron job]]), the
current folder and the current GPS location (available only for macOS).
** My use case
The original reason to create =elcontext= was to setup my development
environment depending on my current location. When I'm at work, I start other
applications than when I'm at home. I use [[https://github.com/rejeep/prodigy.el][prodigy]] to define services I need and
=elcontext= starts them.
** Technical details
A new context is created interactively by using abo-abo's fantastic [[https://github.com/abo-abo/hydra][hydra]]
package: 

[[./hydra.png]]

If a part of a context is omitted this part is always valid e.g. no location
means anywhere, no time means anytime. Each command is triggered once a day.

I used Emacs' [[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/elisp/Tabulated-List-Mode.html][Tabulated List mode]] to get an overview of all created
contexts. Triggered contexts are highlighted in green:

All context data is stored in hash tables which can be created/accessed
conveniently with [[https://github.com/Wilfred/ht.el][ht]] and the GPS coordinated are retrieved via [[https://github.com/purcell/osx-location][osx-location]].
** Conclusion
I am proud I finished my fist Emacs package and would be happy if it's useful to
someone else. If =elcontext= is helpful to you I would be pleased to here about your
use cases.
